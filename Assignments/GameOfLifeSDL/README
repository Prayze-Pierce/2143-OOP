## Project Write-Up
Write-Up
I took my terminal version of Conway’s Game of Life and turned it into a full SDL2 graphical program. The logic from my original automaton stayed the same, but everything around it was rebuilt to 
support graphics, interaction, JSON pattern loading, and command-line configuration.
For the implementation, I built an SdlScreen class that fully replaces the old text renderer. It handles SDL initialization, window creation, drawing the grid, drawing each cell, and managing frame timing.
The SDL application runs an event loop where I process keyboard and mouse input, update the simulation when it’s not paused, and redraw the screen every frame. 
Clicking on the grid toggles cells instantly, and keyboard shortcuts let me pause, step, randomize, clear, quit, and load patterns.
I also implemented a JSON pattern loader. At startup, the program loads shapes.json and keeps the pattern data in memory. 
When the user presses certain keys (like G, B, or O), the pattern is placed at the mouse cursor’s grid location.
This required reading JSON structures, handling offsets, and making sure patterns don’t break when the cursor is near the edges. 
Command-line arguments are also supported, letting me change window size, cell size, and frame delay before launching the program.
The biggest challenges were getting SDL2 set up in the environment, getting the renderer and coordinate math consistent across clicking, drawing, and pattern placement,
and keeping the code modular so it didn’t turn into a mess. The JSON loader also took some trial and error to get right.
If I continued this project, I’d add more UI features like a visible generation counter, adjustable speed controls, 
drag-to-draw for cells, zooming and panning, color themes, and maybe toroidal wrapping so patterns behave differently at the edges. 
The core system works well now, so most improvements would be quality-of-life upgrades.
